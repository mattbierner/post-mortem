+ MacKaye also traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in
+  <i>
+   <a href="/wiki/Thrasher_(magazine)" title="Thrasher (magazine)">
+    Thrasher
+   </a>
+  </i>
+  magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as "emo-core", which he called "the stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life."
+ Other accounts attribute the term to an audience member at an Embrace show, who yelled that the band was "emocore" as an insult.
+ Others contend that MacKaye coined the term when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.
+ The
+  <i>

+ Although many of these bands simultaneously rejected the term, it stuck nonetheless. Scene veteran
+  <a href="/wiki/Jenny_Toomey" title="Jenny Toomey">
+   Jenny Toomey
+  </a>
+  has recalled that "The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. [Rites of Spring] existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music 'grunge,' where you were using the term even though you hated it."

+  The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years. By 1986 most of the major bands of the movement—including Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter, and Beefeater—had broken up.
+ Even so, the ideas and aesthetics originating from the scene spread quickly across the country via a network of homemade
+  <a href="/wiki/Zine" title="Zine">
+   zines
+  </a>
+  , vinyl records, and hearsay.
+ According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for all subsequent incarnations of emo:

+<blockquote>
+ <p>
+  <ins>
+   What had happened in D.C. in the mid-eighties—the shift from anger to action, from extroverted rage to internal turmoil, from an individualized mass to a mass of individuals—was in many ways a test case for the transformation of the national punk scene over the next two decades. The imagery, the power of the music, the way people responded to it, and the way the bands burned out instead of fading away—all have their origins in those first few performances by Rites of Spring. The roots of emo were laid, however unintentionally, by fifty or so people in the nation's capital. And in some ways, it was never as good and surely never as pure again. Certainly, the Washington scene was the only time "emocore" had any consensus definition as a genre.

+  As the ideals of the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, many bands in numerous local scenes began to emulate the sound as a way to marry the intensity of hardcore with the complex emotions associated with growing older.
+ The style combined the fatalism, theatricality, and outsiderness of
+  <a href="/wiki/The_Smiths" title="The Smiths">
+   The Smiths
+  </a>
+  with the uncompromising and dramatic worldview of hardcore.
+ Although the bands were numerous and the locales varied, the aesthetics of emocore in the late 1980s remained more or less the same: "over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music."
+ However, in the early 1990s, several new bands reinvented the emo style and carried its core characteristic, the intimacy between bands and fans, into the new decade.
+ Chief among these were
+  <a href="/wiki/Jawbreaker_(band)" title="Jawbreaker (band)">

+  </a>
+  and
+  <a href="/wiki/Sunny_Day_Real_Estate" title="Sunny Day Real Estate">
+   Sunny Day Real Estate
+  </a>
+  , both of whom fostered cult followings, recontextualized the word "emo", and brought it a step closer to the mainstream.
+ According to Andy Greenwald:
+ </ins>
+</p>
+<blockquote>
+ <p>
+  <ins>
+   Sunny Day Real Estate was emo's head and Jawbreaker its busted gut—the two overlapped in the heart, then broke up before they made it big. Each had a lasting impact on the world of independent music. The bands shared little else but fans, and yet somehow the combination of the two lays down a fairly effective blueprint for everything that was labeled emo for the next decade.

+  , underground music and subcultures in the United States became big business. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts were able to access the national stage.
+ Teenagers across the country declared themselves fans of independent music, and being punk became mainstream.
+ In this new musical climate, the aesthetics of emo expanded into the mainstream and altered the way the music was perceived: "Punk rock no-nos like the

+    Jackson has been singing since a child, and over time his voice and vocal style have notably changed, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chooses to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice "descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor".
+ In the mid-1970s, the singer adopted a "vocal hiccup" as seen in "

+     Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)
+    </a>
+    ". The purpose of the hiccup—somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping—is to help promote a certain emotion, be it excitement, sadness or fear.
+ With the arrival of
+    <i>
+     Off the Wall

+ At the time,

+  Beginning in the late 1990s emo had a surge of popularity in the realm of independent music, as a number of notable acts and record labels experienced successes that would lay the foundation for the style's later mainstream breakthrough. As emo gained a larger fanbase the music business began see its marketing potential, and as big business entered the picture many of the acts previously associated with the term intentionally distanced themselves from it:

+   As the '90s wore to a close, the music that was being labeled emo was making a connection with a larger and larger group of people. the aspects of it that were the most contagious—the sensitivity, hooks, and average-guy appeal—were also the easiest to latch onto, replicate, and mass market. As with any phenomenon—exactly like what happened with Sunny Day [Real Estate]—when business enters into a high-stakes, highly personal sphere, things tend to go awry very quickly [...] As fans threatened to storm the emo bandwagon, the groups couldn't jump off of it fast enough. The popularity and bankability of the word—if not the music—transformed an affiliation with the mid-nineties version of emo into an albatross.

- Jackson has been singing since a child, and over time his voice and vocal style have notably changed, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chooses to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice "descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor".

+   The media business, so desperate for its self-obsessed, post-9/11 predictions of a return to austerity and the death of irony to come true, had found its next big thing. But it was barely a "thing," because no one had heard of it, and those who had couldn't define it. Despite the fact that the hedonistic, materialistic hip-hop of Nelly was still dominating the charts, magazine readers in the summer of '02 were informed that the nation was deep in an introverted healing process, and the way it was healing was by wearing thick black glasses and vintage striped shirts. Emo, we were told, would heal us all through fashion.

+  In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the style became a marketable product.

+ The depoliticized nature of emo, coupled with its catchy music and accessible themes, gave it a broad appeal to young mainstream audiences.

+  Emo has been criticized for its
+  <a href="/wiki/Androcentrism" title="Androcentrism">
+   androcentrism
+  </a>
+  and the tendency of most emo bands to relegate women to the role of muse or heartbreaker in their lyrics.
+  <a href="/wiki/Andy_Greenwald" title="Andy Greenwald">
+   Andy Greenwald
+  </a>
+  notes that there are very few women in emo bands, and that even those few do not typically have an active voice in the songs' subject matter: "Though emo—and to a certain degree, punk—has always been a typically male province, the monotony of the labels' gender perspective can be overwhelming."
+ The triumph of the "lonely boy's aesthetic" in emo, coupled with the style's popularity, has led to a litany of one-sided songs in which males vent their fury at the women who have wronged them:
+ </ins>
+</p>
+<blockquote>
+ <p>
+  <ins>
+   The way typical emo bands sing about women is a volatile mixture of
+   <a href="/wiki/Ian_MacKaye" title="Ian MacKaye">
+    Ian MacKaye
+   </a>
+   's strident puritanism—as in sex equals fear, failure, weakness—and self-obsessed sexist
+   <a href="/wiki/Solipsism" title="Solipsism">
+    solipsism
+   </a>
+   . If mid-nineties emo was mostly about not meeting girls or running away from them, emo's national generation dumbed it down and amped it up. Now emo songwriters were one-sided victims of heartbreak, utterly wronged and ready to sing about it, with the women having no chance to respond.
+  </ins>
+ </p>
+</blockquote>
+<p>
+ <ins>
+  Many emo songs both admit sadness and revel in it, exhibiting a phobia of women that seems to celebrate a perpetual adolescence:
+ "The singers may pretend to hang themselves out to dry by copping to crying and being sad at night, but in the heightened emo environment, where broken hearts are badges of honor, it's a hollow boast. Their scars are a sign of pride—you're the one onstage bragging about how upset you are—but there's no attempt at actual conversation or relationship building."
+ Some emo bands' lyrics go so far as to disguise violent anti-women sentiments in a veneer of pop music.
+ Greenwald cites

+  </a>
+  of

+ However, despite emo's frequent portrayal of women as powerless victims, fans of the style are almost evenly split between genders and some acts have even greater popularity with women than with men.
+ One explanation for this is that the unifying appeal of emo, its expression of emotional devastation, can be appreciated equally by both sexes regardless of the songs' specific subjects.
