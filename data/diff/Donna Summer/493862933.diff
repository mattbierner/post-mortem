+  Summer was born Ladonna Adrian Gaines on December 31, 1948 in Boston, Massachusetts to parents Andrew and Mary Gaines and was one of seven children.
+ She and her family were raised in the Boston neighborhood of
+  <a href="/wiki/Dorchester,_Boston" title="Dorchester, Boston">
+   Dorchester
+  </a>
+  . Her father, Andrew Gaines, was a butcher, and her mother Mary, was a schoolteacher.
+ Summer's mother later recalled that from the time she could talk, Summer would often sing: "She literally loved to sing. She used to go through the house singing, singing. She sang for breakfast and for lunch and for supper."
+ </ins>
+</p>
+<p>
+ <ins>
+  Summer's performance debut occurred at church when she was ten years old, when she replaced a vocalist who had failed to show up.
+ Her priest invited Summer to perform, judging from her small frame and speaking voice that she would be an "amusing spectacle", but instead Summer's voice recalled a voice older than her years and frame.
+ Summer herself recalled that as she sang, "I started crying, everybody else started crying. It was quite an amazing moment in my life and at some point after I heard my voice came out I felt like God was saying to me 'Donna, you're going to be very, very famous' and I knew from that day on that I would be famous."

+ Summer later attended Boston's Jeremiah E. Burke High School, where she performed in school musicals and was considered popular.
+ She was also something of a troublemaker, skipping home to attend parties, circumventing her parents' strict curfew.
