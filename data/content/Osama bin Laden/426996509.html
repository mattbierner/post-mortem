<p>
 There is no universally accepted standard in the West for
 <a href="/wiki/Transliteration" title="Transliteration">
  transliterating
 </a>
 Arabic words and names into English, so bin Laden's name is spelled in many different ways. The version translation most often used by English-language mass media is
 <i>
  Osama bin Laden
 </i>
 . Most American government agencies, including the FBI and
 <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">
  CIA
 </a>
 , use either "
 <i>
  Usama bin Laden
 </i>
 " or "
 <i>
  Usama bin Ladin
 </i>
 ", both of which are often abbreviated to
 <i>
  UBL
 </i>
 . Less common renderings include "
 <i>
  Ussamah Bin Ladin
 </i>
 " and "
 <i>
  Oussama Ben Laden
 </i>
 " (French-language mass media). The last two words of the name can also be found as "
 <i>
  Binladen
 </i>
 " or (as used by his family in the West) "
 <i>
  Binladin
 </i>
 ". The spelling with "o" and "e" comes from a Persian-influenced pronunciation used in Afghanistan where he lived for a long time.
</p>
<p>
 Strictly speaking, Arabic
 <a href="/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">
  linguistic
 </a>
 conventions dictate that he be referred to as "Osama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "bin Laden", as "Bin Laden" is not used as a surname in the Western manner, but simply as part of his name, which in its long form means "Osama, son of Mohammed, son of 'Awad, son of Laden". Still, "bin Laden" has become nearly universal in Western references to him.

 Bin Laden has consistently dwelt on the need for violent jihad to right what he believes are injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and sometimes by other non-Muslim states,
 the need to eliminate the state of
 <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">

 Bin Laden is

 bin Laden opposes music on religious grounds,

<p>
 By 1988, bin Laden had split from
 <a href="/wiki/Maktab_al-Khidamat" title="Maktab al-Khidamat">
  Maktab al-Khidamat
 </a>
 . While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force.
 Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (
 <i>
  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bay%27at" title="Bay'at">
   bayat
  </a>
 </i>
 ) to follow one's superiors.
</p>
<p>
 According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret."
 His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between "several senior leaders" of Egyptian Islamic Jihad,
 <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_Yusuf_Azzam" title="Abdullah Yusuf Azzam">
  Abdullah Azzam
 </a>
 , and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.
 Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia in 1990 as a hero of jihad, who along with his Arab legion, "had brought down the mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union.
 The Iraqi
 <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait" title="Invasion of Kuwait">

 on August 2, 1990 had put the kingdom and its ruling
 <a href="/wiki/House_of_Saud" title="House of Saud">

 <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">

 </a>
 were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent. bin Laden met with
 <a href="/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia" title="Fahd of Saudi Arabia">
  King Fahd
 </a>
 , and Sultan, Minister of Defense of Saudi Arabia, telling them not to depend on non-Muslim troops, and offered to help defend Saudi Arabia with his
 <a href="/wiki/Mujahideen" title="Mujahideen">
  mujahideen
 </a>
 fighters. Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and after the American offer to help repel Iraq from Kuwait was accepted, involving deploying U.S. troops in Saudi territory,
 he publicly denounced Saudi Arabia's dependence on the U.S. military, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the "land of the two mosques" (
 <a href="/wiki/Mecca" title="Mecca">

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Medina" title="Medina">

 led that
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government_of_Saudi_Arabia" title="Government of Saudi Arabia">

 </a>
 to attempt to silence him.
</p>
<p>
 Shortly after Saudi Arabia permitted U.S. troops on Saudi soil, bin Laden turned his attention to attacks on the west. On November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of

 <a href="/wiki/Meir_Kahane" title="Meir Kahane">

</p>
<p>
 Bin Laden continued to speak publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, for which the Saudis banished him. He went to live in exile in Sudan, in 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed.

 In Sudan, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations, in

</p>
<p>
 Bin Laden continued his verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and in response, on March 5, 1994, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend, the equivalent of $7 million a year.
 By now bin Laden was strongly associated with
 <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_Islamic_Jihad" title="Egyptian Islamic Jihad">

 (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ

 . The attempt failed, and the EIJ was expelled from Sudan.
</p>
<p>
 Sudan also began efforts to expel bin Laden. The 9/11 Commission Report states:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  "In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the
  <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">
   Central Intelligence Agency

  (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer
  <a href="/wiki/Billy_Waugh" title="Billy Waugh">
   Billy Waugh
  </a>
  tracked down Bin Ladin in the Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization.
  US Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. Sudan’s minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The
 <a href="/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report" title="9/11 Commission Report">
  9/11 Commission Report
 </a>
 further states:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  "In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. US officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, or both."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 In May 1996, under increasing pressure on Sudan, from Saudi Arabia,
 <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">

 When Bin Laden left Sudan, he and his organization were significantly weakened, despite his ambitions and organizational skills.
 In Afghanistan, bin Laden and Al-Qaeda raised money from "donors from the days of the Soviet jihad", and from the Pakistani

According to Middle East intelligence reports, bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in

 He was convicted of colluding with Osama bin Laden by a French court.
</p>
<p>
 A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former mujahideen who are linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists who have lived in this area 60 miles (97 km) north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years.

In its June 26, 1997 Report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Osama bin Laden.

 In 1999 it was revealed that Osama bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and

 </a>
 and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that bin Laden "did not personally collect his Bosnian passport" and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.
 The Bosnian daily
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Oslobo%C4%91enje" title="Oslobođenje">

 After reports of repeated initial denials,
 in 2004 Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
 The attacks involved the hijacking of four commercial passenger aircraft,

 has stated that classified
 evidence linking Al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks of September 11 is clear and irrefutable.
 The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's culpability for the September 11, 2001, attacks although the government report notes that the evidence presented is insufficient for
 <i>

 Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On September 16, 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast by

 in a way that indicates foreknowledge.
 The tape was broadcast on various news networks on December 13, 2001. The merits of this translation have been disputed. Arabist Dr. Abdel El M.

 In the

Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists.
</p>
<p>
 Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama Bin Laden. It wasn't until after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial, in return for the US ending the bombing and providing evidence that Osama bin Laden was involved in the 9/11 attacks. This offer was rejected by George W Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable with Bush responding that "There's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty."

 Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, US government officials named bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death.
 On July 13, 2007, this figure was doubled to $50 million.

  Conflicting reports of his death and his survival since 9/11

<p>
 Shortly after the attacks of
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/9/11" title="9/11">
  9/11
 </a>
 , then US president George W. Bush issued a statement that as a consequence of the 9/11 attacks, he now hoped to "kill or capture" Bin Laden. Subsequently, Bin Laden retreated further from public contact as an obviously defensive measure against potential US capture. Since that time, numerous speculative press reports have been issued concerning various hearsay stories about his whereabouts, and also about alleged evidence of his supposed death. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda has continued to release time sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating Bin Laden's continued survival as recently as August 2007.
 Most recently, US General McChrystal emphasized the continued importance of the capture or killing of Bin Laden, thus clearly indicating that the US high command continues to believe that Bin Laden is probably still alive. Following are some of these conflicting reports regarding both his claimed death, and his claimed continued whereabouts:

 Quoting an unnamed Taliban official, the

 reported that Bin Laden died of untreated lung complications and was buried in an unmarked grave in Tora Bora on December 15.
 This report was picked up by Fox News in the United States on December 26.
 Also on December 26, the Egyptian newspaper
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AlWafd_-_Daily" title="AlWafd - Daily">

 </a>
 by a
 <i>

 </i>
 of the Afghan Taliban, who was allegedly present at the funeral, stating Bin Laden had been buried on or about December 13:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  "(Osama bin Laden) suffered serious complications and died a natural, quiet death. He was buried in Tora Bora, a funeral attended by 30 Al Qaeda fighters, close members of his family and friends from the Taliban. By the Wahhabi tradition, no mark was left on the grave"
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 A videotape was released on December 27 showing a gaunt, unwell Bin Laden, prompting an unnamed White House aide to comment that it could have been made shortly before his death.
 On CNN, Dr Sanjay Gupta commented that Bin Laden's left arm never moved during the video, suggesting a recent stroke and possibly a symptom of kidney failure.
 According to Pakistani President Musharraf, Bin Laden required two dialysis machines, which also suggests kidney failure.
 "I think now, frankly, he is dead for the reason he is a... kidney patient," Musharraf said.
 If Bin Laden suffered kidney failure, he would require a sterile environment, electricity, and continuous attention by a team of specialists, Gupta said.
 In April 2002, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld stated, "We have heard neither hide nor hair of him since, oh, about December in terms of anything hard."
 FBI Counterterrorism chief Dale Watson and President Karzai of Afghanistan also expressed the opinion that Bin Laden probably died at this time.

 Claims as to the location of Osama bin Laden have been made since December 2001, although none have been definitively proven and some have placed Osama in different locations during overlapping time periods. Since a major military offensive in Afghanistan in the wake of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks in the United States failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan had regularly been identified as his suspected hiding place.
