 Hunter S. Thompson is often portrayed in popular culture as a dangerously absurd,
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Illegal_drugs" title="Illegal drugs">
  drug
 </a>
 -crazed journalist bent on comic self-destruction. While this portrayal is certainly not completely inaccurate, he is also considered by many to be one of the most important American writers of the
 <a href="/wiki/20th_century" title="20th century">

 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Thompson is known for an explosive writing style that employs what he calls “
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Action_verbs" title="Action verbs">
  action verbs
 </a>
 ” to comically spin outlandish tales that are completely unbelievable, yet providing a unique viewpoint to accurately describe the underling reality at hand. Thompson almost always writes in the
 <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/First_person" title="First person">
  first person
 </a>
 narrative, and his stories become so colorfully contrived that they easily slip into the realm of fiction, however the basic framework of the story he is telling is often very true. Thompson’s writing style exploits this void between the realms of fiction and non-fiction, and it has become known as

 and
 <i>
  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Rum_Diary" title="The Rum Diary">

 ) and copious amounts of
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Short_stories" title="Short stories">

 </a>
 , none of which were published despite relentless submissions to publishers. Kennedy later remarked that he and Thompson were cohorts in the fact that they were, at the time, failed novelists who had turned to journalism in order to make a living.

<p>
 Thompson got his big break when he pitched a story to
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine" title="Harper's Magazine">

 about his relationship with the

 Thompson frequently refers to himself as "Raoul Duke" or "Dr. Gonzo." He received his '

 ' from a mail-order church in the sixties.
</p>
<p>
 Some of Thompson's other books include
 <i>

</p>
<p>
 Thompson has identified the death of the

 </a>
 as his “reporter’s beat”, and has covered the subject in one fashion or another throughout his writing. During an interview with
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salon.com" title="Salon.com">
  salon.com
 </a>
 , however, Thompson was asked whether he was not, in fact, the living embodiment of the classic American Dream. He answered the question by first screaming a string of frustrated obscenities and then admitting that, in actuality, he probably was.
</p>
<p>
 A slogan of Thompson's, "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro," appears as a chapter heading in
 <i>
  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
 </i>
 He has also been quoted as saying "I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."
</p>
<p>
 His latest book,

  Kingdom of Fear

 , is an angry commentary on the passing of the
