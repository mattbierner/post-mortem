 Part of President Reagan's first term in office focused on reviving an inherited economy exhibiting stagflation, or both

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">

  tax cuts

 . Most economists agree that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but supply-siders say that they have a much greater effect than most economists say they would.
 <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" title="George H. W. Bush">

 had called Reagan's economic ideas "
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Voodoo_economics" title="Voodoo economics">

 " prior to becoming his vice-president. Reagan's policies soon became known as "
 <a href="/wiki/Reaganomics" title="Reaganomics">
  Reaganomics
 </a>
 ", a nickname used by both his supporters and detractors. These tax cuts combined with heavy military spending increases led to enormous
 <a href="/wiki/Deficit_spending" title="Deficit spending">
  deficit spending
 </a>
 and a dramatic increase in the
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_debt" title="National debt">
  national debt
 </a>
 . The debt increased by approximately 200% (tripled) between when Reagan took office and when his successor,
 <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" title="George H. W. Bush">
  George H. W. Bush
 </a>
 , took office. Reagan's supporters note that although the President writes an annual budget proposal, the actual spending bill originates in the
 <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="United States House of Representatives">
  House of Representatives
 </a>
 , so Reagan's policies are not the exclusive cause of the debt increase.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, this spending was slightly offset by increased tax revenues, and some supporters of Reagan attribute this to the successful use of supply-side economics tax policies. Critics of President Reagan argue that despite his frequent pronouncements that he advocated smaller and less intrusive government, federal spending and bureaucracy increased in size during his administration. Not surprisingly, there is disagreement over how much Reagan's policies contributed to the severe
 <a href="/wiki/Recession" title="Recession">
  recession
 </a>
 that took place in
 <a href="/wiki/1982" title="1982">
  1982
 </a>
 , the strong economic expansion that began late in his first term and ran throughout his second term, and the fall in the average inflation-adjusted hourly wage for American workers that happened between his 1981 swearing-in and his successor's 1989 swearing-in.

 (SDI), a missile defense system which he hoped would make the U.S. invulnerable to nuclear missile attack by the

 . SDI was dubbed "Star Wars" by opponents, connoting the fantastic or impractical.

 Critics of SDI argued that the technological objective was unattainable in practical terms, and that the attempt would be likely to increase the
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arms_Race" title="Arms Race">

 , as well as increasing the instability of future international crises. Other critics saw the extraordinary expenditures involved in the multiple distinct SDI programs as a military-industrial boondoggle. Supporters call SDI the nail in the coffin of the arms race with the Soviet Union through the application the
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Strategy_of_technology" title="Strategy of technology">

 Reagan quickly called for the appointment of an
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Office_of_the_Independent_Counsel" title="Office of the Independent Counsel">
  Independent Counsel
 </a>
 to investigate the wider scandal. His cooperation with counsel helped Iran-Contra from seriously damaging his presidency. It was found that the President was guilty of the scandal only in that his lax control of his own staff resulted in his ignorance of the arms sale. Although Reagan himself was considered personally honest by most Americans, other scandals occurred involving bribery, corruption, and influence peddling among some of Reagan's aides and subordinates, resulting in a significant number of officials in the Reagan Administration either being convicted or forced to resign their posts to avoid prosecution. The failure of these scandals to damage Reagan's reputation led Congressman Patricia Schroeder to dub him the "

 President", a term that has been occasionally attached to later Presidents and their scandals.

 for drug offenders while cutting funding for addiction treatment. This resulted in a dramatic increase in the USA's prison population. Critics charged that the policies did little to actually reduce the availability of drugs or crime on the street while resulting in a great financial and human cost for American society. Due to this policy and various cuts in spending for social programs during his Presidency, Reagan was regarded by some critics as indifferent to the needs of poor and minority citizens. Nevertheless, surveys showed that illegal drug use among Americans declined significantly during Reagan's presidency, leading supporters to argue that the policies were successful.
