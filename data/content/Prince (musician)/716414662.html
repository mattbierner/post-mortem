 His parents were both African-American
 and his family ancestry is centered in

 </a>
 , with all four of his grandparents hailing from that state.
 Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter and his mother was a

 singer. Prince was named after his father, whose
 <a href="/wiki/Stage_name" title="Stage name">

 , Prince's father said, "I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do".
 Prince's childhood nickname was Skipper.
</p>
<p>
 In a

 that he was "born

</p>
<p>
 Prince's sister Tika Evene (usually called Tyka) was born in 1960.
 Both siblings developed a keen interest in music, and this was encouraged by their father.
 Prince wrote his first tune, "Funk Machine", on his father's piano when he was seven.
 When Prince was ten years old, his parents separated. Prince constantly switched homes following the separation, sometimes living with his father and sometimes with his mother and stepfather.
 Finally, he moved into the home of neighbors named the Andersons and befriended their son Andre Anderson, who later became known as
 <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Cymone" title="André Cymone">

 Prince and Anderson joined Prince's cousin Charles Smith in a band called Grand Central while they were attending Minneapolis's Central High School. Smith was later replaced by

 In 1975, Pepe Willie, the husband of Prince's cousin, Shauntel, formed the band
 <a href="/wiki/94_East" title="94 East">

 </a>
 with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry. Willie hired André Cymone and Prince to record tracks with 94 East. Those songs were written by Willie and Prince contributed guitar tracks. Prince also co-wrote, with Willie, the 94 East song, "Just Another Sucker". The band recorded tracks which later became the album
 <i>
  Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings
 </i>
 . Prince also recorded, but never released, a song written by Willie, "If You See Me" (also known as, "Do Yourself a Favor"). In 1995, Willie released the album

  94 East featuring Prince, Symbolic Beginning

 , which included original recordings by Prince and Cymone.

 In 1976, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in Moon's Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman. Husney signed Prince, at the age of 17, to a management contract and helped Prince create a demo recording at

 Studios in Minneapolis using producer/engineer David Z. The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies including

<p>
 Prior to the disbanding of The Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, The Revolution album
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Dream_Factory_(album)" title="Dream Factory (album)">
   Dream Factory
  </a>
 </i>
 and a solo effort,
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Unreleased_Prince_projects" title="Unreleased Prince projects">
   Camille
  </a>
 </i>
 .
 Unlike the three previous band albums,
 <i>
  Dream Factory
 </i>
 included significant input from the band members and even featured a number of songs with lead vocals by Wendy &amp; Lisa,
 while the
 <i>
  Camille
 </i>
 project saw Prince create a new persona primarily singing in a speeded-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of The Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Ball_(unreleased_album)" title="Crystal Ball (unreleased album)">
   Crystal Ball
  </a>
 </i>
 .
 However, Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album and
 <i>
  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sign_%22O%22_the_Times" title='Sign "O" the Times'>
   Sign "O" the Times
  </a>
 </i>
 was released on March 31, 1987.
</p>
<p>
 The album peaked at No.6 on the
 <i>
  Billboard
 </i>
 200 albums chart.
 The first single, "
 <a href="/wiki/Sign_o%27_the_Times_(song)" title="Sign o' the Times (song)">
  Sign o' the Times
 </a>
 ", would chart at No. 3 on the Hot 100.
 The follow-up single, "
 <a href="/wiki/If_I_Was_Your_Girlfriend" title="If I Was Your Girlfriend">
  If I Was Your Girlfriend
 </a>
 " charted poorly at No. 67 on the Hot 100, but went to No.12 on R&amp;B chart.

</p>
<p>
 Despite receiving the greatest critical acclaim of any album in Prince's career, including being named the top album of the year by the
 <a href="/wiki/Pazz_%26_Jop" title="Pazz &amp; Jop">
  Pazz &amp; Jop
 </a>
 critics' poll, and eventually selling 3.2 million copies, album sales steadily declined.
 In Europe, however, it performed well and Prince promoted the album overseas with a lengthy tour. Putting together a new backing band from the remnants of The Revolution, Prince added bassist Levi Seacer, Jr., Boni Boyer on keyboards, and dancer/choreographer Cat Glover to go with new drummer Sheila E. and holdovers Miko Weaver, Doctor Fink, Eric Leeds, Atlanta Bliss, and the Bodyguards (Jerome, Wally Safford, and Greg Brooks) for the
 <a href="/wiki/Sign_o%27_the_Times_Tour" title="Sign o' the Times Tour">
  Sign o' the Times Tour
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The tour was a success overseas, with Warner Bros. and Prince's managers wanting to bring it to the US to resuscitate sagging sales of
 <i>
  Sign "O" the Times
 </i>
 ;
 however, Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album.
 As a compromise the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar and reshoots were performed at his Paisley Park studios.
 The film
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Sign_o%27_the_Times_(film)" title="Sign o' the Times (film)">
   Sign o' the Times
  </a>
 </i>
 was released on November 20, 1987. Much like the album, the film garnered more critical praise than the previous year's
 <i>
  Under the Cherry Moon
 </i>
 ; however, its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.
</p>
<p>
 The next album intended for release was to be
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/The_Black_Album_(Prince_album)" title="The Black Album (Prince album)">
   The Black Album
  </a>
 </i>
 .
 More instrumental and funk and R&amp;B themed than recent releases,
 <i>
  The Black Album
 </i>
 also saw Prince experiment with
 <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" title="Hip hop music">
  hip hop music
 </a>
 on the songs "Bob George" and "Dead on It". Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed,
 Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was evil and had it recalled.
 It would later be released by Warner Bros. as a limited edition album in 1994. Prince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Lovesexy" title="Lovesexy">
   Lovesexy
  </a>
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Released on May 10, 1988,
 <i>
  Lovesexy
 </i>
 serves as a spiritual opposite to the dark
 <i>
  The Black Album
 </i>
 .
 Every song is a solo effort by Prince, with exception of "Eye No" which was recorded with his backing band at the time, dubbed the "Lovesexy Band" by fans.
 <i>
  Lovesexy
 </i>
 would reach No. 11 on the
 <i>
  Billboard
 </i>
 200 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B albums chart.
 The lead single, "
 <a href="/wiki/Alphabet_St." title="Alphabet St.">
  Alphabet St.
 </a>
 ", peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&amp;B chart,
 but finished with only selling 750,000 copies.
</p>
<p>
 Prince again took his post-Revolution backing band (minus the Bodyguards) on a three leg, 84-show
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lovesexy_World_Tour" title="Lovesexy World Tour">

 " went to No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart.
 However, he did have to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
 In 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his stripped down, back-to-basics
 <a href="/wiki/Nude_Tour" title="Nude Tour">
  Nude Tour
 </a>
 . With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the horns, and Cat, Prince brought in Rosie Gaines on keys, drummer

 <a href="/wiki/Tony_M." title="Tony M.">
  Tony M.
 </a>
 , Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with its short, greatest hits setlist.
 As the year progressed, Prince finished production on his fourth film,
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Graffiti_Bridge_(film)" title="Graffiti Bridge (film)">
   Graffiti Bridge
  </a>
 </i>
 , and the

 </i>
 as well as the involvement of the original members of The Time, the studio greenlit the project.
 Released on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the

 The album, generally referred to as the
 <i>

 While the label wanted "

 After two failed attempts in 1990 and 1991,
 Warner Bros. finally released a
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Greatest_hits" title="Greatest hits">
  greatest hits
 </a>
 compilation with the three-disc
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/The_Hits/The_B-Sides" title="The Hits/The B-Sides">

  </a>
 </i>
 in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as
 <i>
  The Hits 1
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  The Hits 2
 </i>
 . In addition to featuring the majority of Prince's hit singles (with the exception of "
 <a href="/wiki/Batdance" title="Batdance">

 </a>
 " and other songs that appeared on the
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Batman_(album)" title="Batman (album)">

 soundtrack),
 <i>
  The Hits
 </i>
 includes an array of previously hard-to-find recordings, notably
 <a href="/wiki/A-side_and_B-side" title="A-side and B-side">

 </a>
 spanning the majority of Prince's career, as well as a handful of previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded "Power Fantastic" and a live recording of "

</p>
<p>
 1993 also marked the year in which Prince changed his stage name to
 <a class="image" href="/wiki/File:Prince_logo.svg">
  <img alt="Prince logo.svg" data-file-height="153" data-file-width="130" height="15" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Prince_logo.svg/13px-Prince_logo.svg.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Prince_logo.svg/20px-Prince_logo.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Prince_logo.svg/26px-Prince_logo.svg.png 2x" width="13"/>
 </a>
 , which was explained as a combination of the
 <a href="/wiki/Gender_symbol" title="Gender symbol">
  symbols
 </a>
 for male (♂) and female (♀).
 In order to use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. had to organize a mass mailing of
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floppy_disks" title="Floppy disks">
  floppy disks
 </a>
 with a custom font.
 In those days, a commonly used typed approximation of the Symbol was "O(+&gt;". The symbol would soon be dubbed "The Love Symbol" and Prince would be referred to as "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince", "TAFKAP", or simply "The Artist". Later, when he changed his name back to Prince again, he was sometimes called "The Artist Formerly Known as 'The Artist Formerly Known as Prince'".

 </span>
</h3>
<p>
 In 1994, Prince's attitude towards his artistic output underwent a notable shift. He began to view releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. The label, he believed, was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting that he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of the
 <i>
  Love Symbol Album
 </i>
 , claiming that it was insufficiently marketed by Warner. It was out of these developments that the aborted
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/The_Black_Album_(Prince_album)" title="The Black Album (Prince album)">
   The Black Album
  </a>
 </i>
 was officially released, approximately seven years after its initial recording and near-release. The "new" release, which was already in wide circulation as a
 <a href="/wiki/Bootleg_recording" title="Bootleg recording">
  bootleg
 </a>
 , sold relatively poorly.
</p>
<p>
 Following that disappointing venture, Warner Bros. succumbed to Prince's wishes to release an album of new material, to be entitled
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Come_(Prince_album)" title="Come (Prince album)">
   Come
  </a>
 </i>
 . When
 <i>
  Come
 </i>
 was eventually released, it confirmed all of Warner's fears. It became Prince's poorest-selling album to date, struggling to even shift 500,000 copies. Even more frustrating was the fact that Prince insisted on crediting the album to "Prince 1958–1993".
</p>
<p>
 Prince pushed to have his next album
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/The_Gold_Experience" title="The Gold Experience">
   The Gold Experience
  </a>
 </i>
 released simultaneously with
 <i>
  Love Symbol
 </i>

 <a href="/wiki/The_Most_Beautiful_Girl_in_the_World_(Prince_song)" title="The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)">
  The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
 </a>
 " to be released via a small, independent distributor,
 <a href="/wiki/Bellmark_Records" title="Bellmark Records">

 </a>
 , in February 1994. The release was successful, reaching No. 3 on the US
 <i>
  Billboard
 </i>
 Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it would not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing
 <i>
  The Gold Experience
 </i>
 , fearing poor sales and citing "
 <a href="/wiki/Market_saturation" title="Market saturation">

 <i>
  The Gold Experience

 failed to sell well, although it reached the top 10 of the

 </i>
 200 initially, and many reviewed it as Prince's best effort since

The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was eventually shipped to them; these pre-orders were eventually delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the

 disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail, one being in a four-disc sized jewel case with a simple white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle; the other is all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The

 On May 16, 2000, Prince ceased using the Love Symbol moniker and returned to using "Prince" again, after his publishing contract with
 <a href="/wiki/Warner/Chappell_Music" title="Warner/Chappell Music">
  Warner/Chappell
 </a>
 expired. In a press conference, he stated that, after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name "Prince", he would formally revert to using his real name. Prince still frequently uses the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and continues to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar. For several years following the release of
 <i>
  Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic
 </i>
 , Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com (later NPGMusicClub.com). Two albums that show substantive jazz influence were available commercially at record stores: 2001's

 <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Records" title="Columbia Records">

 went to court to sue Prince for €1.6 million, after paying him $1.5 million, half his agreed fee of $3 million for the concert. MCD claim they had to refund 55,126 tickets purchased and its total losses exceeded $1.66 million. Prince's lawyers argued the MCD claim was "greatly inflated".
 Prince settled the case out of court in February 2010 for $2.95 million.
 During the trial, it was revealed that Prince had been offered $22 million for seven concerts as part of a proposed 2008 European tour.
 In October 2008, Prince released a live album entitled

 In addition to his singing abilities (which encompass a wide range from falsetto to baritone and rapid, flamboyant shifts of register, as well as diverse characterisation) Prince is one of pop music's most prominent multi-instrumentalists. The precise number of instruments he is capable of playing remains obscure, partly due to the active mythologizing of his abilities and working practices (such as the claim that he had played "all 27 instruments" on his debut album, which appears to have included various different kinds of guitar, keyboard and synthesizer in the total).
</p>
<p>
 As a live performer he tends to focus on guitar, piano, lead vocals and occasional bass, drums and harmonica. On recordings he has also played assorted keyboards and synthesizers, bass guitar, drums, various percussion instruments and saxophone, as well as mastering both drum and synthesizer programming. Prince has mentioned learning and performing simple parts on particular instruments that he does not otherwise play (such as concert harp) in order to serve song arrangements on albums.

 In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/The_Gold_Experience" title="The Gold Experience">
   The Gold Experience
  </a>
 </i>
 , a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, he appeared in public with the word "slave" written on his cheek. Prince explained his name change as follows:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
 <p>
  The first step I have taken toward the ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains that bind me to Warner Bros. was to change my name from Prince to the Love Symbol. Prince is the name that my mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros...
 </p>
 <p>
  I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was the Love Symbol, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Prince has used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music (either his own or that of others) for which he has had input; "I was just getting tired of seeing my name," he said, "If you give away an idea, you still own that idea. In fact, giving it away strengthens it. Why do people feel they have to take credit for everything they do? Ego, that's the only reason."
 These pseudonyms include:

 <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">

 and
 <a href="/wiki/EBay" title="EBay">
  eBay
 </a>
 because they "are clearly able [to] filter porn and pedophile material but appear to choose not to filter out the unauthorized music and film content which is core to their business success." Prince hired the international Internet policing company
 <a href="/wiki/Web_Sheriff" title="Web Sheriff">

 , and they told Reuters: "The problem is that one can reduce it to zero and then the next day there will be 100 or 500 or whatever. This carries on ad nauseam at Prince's expense."

<p>
 In October 2007,
 <a href="/wiki/Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp." title="Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.">
  Stephanie Lenz filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Publishing Group
 </a>
 claiming that they were abusing copyright law after the music publisher had YouTube take down Lenz's home movie in which the Prince song "

</p>
<p>
 On November 5, 2007, several fan sites of Prince formed "Prince Fans United" to fight back against legal requests which, they claim, Prince made to cease and desist all use of photographs, images, lyrics, album covers, and anything linked to Prince's likeness.
 Prince's lawyers claimed that the use of such representations constituted copyright infringement, while the Prince Fans United claimed that the legal actions were "attempts to stifle all critical commentary about Prince." A few days later, Prince released a statement denying the fansites' claims, stating, "The action taken earlier this week was not to shut down fansites, or control comment in any way. The issue was simply to do with in regards to copyright and trademark of images and only images, and no lawsuits have been filed." The statement from Prince's promoter
 <a href="/wiki/Anschutz_Entertainment_Group" title="Anschutz Entertainment Group">
  AEG
 </a>
 asserted that the only "offending items" on the three fansites were live shots from Prince's 21 nights in London at the O2 Arena earlier in the year.
</p>
<p>
 On November 8, 2007, Prince Fans United received a song named "PFUnk", providing a kind of "unofficial answer" to their movement. The song originally debuted on the PFU main site,
 was retitled "

We also ask our members to avoid photoshopping Prince and posting them on our boards."

 At the 2008 Coachella Music Festival, Prince performed a cover of

 Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos while Radiohead claimed, "it's our song, let people hear it." In 2009, Prince put the video of that Coachella performance on his official website LotusFlow3r.com.

 In 2013, the

 In January 2014, Prince filed a lawsuit titled Prince v. Chodera against 22 online users for direct copyright infringement, unauthorized fixation, and contributory copyright infringement and bootlegging.
 Several of the users were fans who had shared links to bootlegged versions of several Prince concerts through social media websites like Facebook.
 In the same month, he dismissed the entire action without prejudice.

He summoned me to his house—and it's foolish to do this to an Irish woman—he said he didn't like me saying bad words in interviews. So I told him to fuck off." O'Connor alleged that the row became physical. "He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine."
