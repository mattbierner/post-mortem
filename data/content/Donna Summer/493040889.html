The group was short-lived, as they split upon their arrival in

 She also sang as a studio session singer and in theaters. In 1971, while still using her birth name Donna Gaines, she released her first single, a cover of "
 <a href="/wiki/Sally_Go_%27Round_the_Roses" title="Sally Go 'Round the Roses">
  Sally Go 'Round the Roses
 </a>
 ", though it was not a hit. In 1972, she married Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer and gave birth to their daughter Mimi Sommer in 1973. Citing marital problems caused by her affair with German artist (and future live-in boyfriend) Peter Mühldorfer, she divorced Helmuth but kept his last name, anglicising it to 'Summer'. She also worked on an album with keyboardist/producer Veit Marvos in 1972, providing backing vocals on his Ariola records release
 <i>
  Nice To See You
 </i>
 (where she was credited under the pseudonym Gayn Pierre). Several single releases over the years have included a young Donna performing with the group, even though she often denied ever singing on any of the Marvos releases. It should also be noted that the name 'Gayn Pierre' was also used by Donna whilst performing in 'Godspell' with Helmuth Sommer during 1972.

 It was while singing background for the hit-making 1970s trio
 <a href="/wiki/Three_Dog_Night" title="Three Dog Night">

 that Summer met producers
 <a href="/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder" title="Giorgio Moroder">
  Giorgio Moroder
 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Pete_Bellotte" title="Pete Bellotte">
  Pete Bellotte
 </a>
 . She eventually signed a deal with the European label Groovy Records and issued her first album,
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Lady_of_the_Night_(album)" title="Lady of the Night (album)">
   Lady of the Night
  </a>
 </i>
 , in 1974. The album was not released in America, but found some limited European success on the strength of the song "
 <a href="/wiki/The_Hostage_(song)" title="The Hostage (song)">
  The Hostage
 </a>
 ", which reached number one in
 <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">

 </a>
 and number two in the
 <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">

 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In 1975, Summer approached Moroder with an idea for a song she and Bellotte were working on for another singer. She had come up with the lyric "love to love you, baby". Moroder was interested in developing the new sound that was becoming popular and used Summer's lyric to develop the song. Moroder persuaded Summer to record what was to be a demo track for another performer. She later said that she had thought of how the song might sound if
 <a href="/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">
  Marilyn Monroe
 </a>
 had sung it and began cooing the lyrics. To get into the mood of recording the song, she requested Moroder turn off the lights while they sat on a sofa with him inducing her moans and groans. After hearing playback of the song, Moroder felt Summer's version should actually be released. Although some radio stations refused to play it due to its suggestive style, "Love to Love You" found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the
 <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">
  United Kingdom
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The song was then sent to
 <a href="/wiki/Casablanca_Records" title="Casablanca Records">
  Casablanca Records
 </a>
 president
 <a href="/wiki/Neil_Bogart" title="Neil Bogart">
  Neil Bogart
 </a>
 in hopes of getting an American release. Bogart informed Summer and Moroder he would release the song (now called "
 <a href="/wiki/Love_to_Love_You_Baby_(song)" title="Love to Love You Baby (song)">
  Love to Love You Baby
 </a>
 ") but requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discothèques. Moroder, Bellotte, and Summer returned with a 17 minute version and Casablanca signed Summer and released the single in November 1975. The shorter version of the single was promoted to radio stations whilst clubs (mostly gay) regularly played the 17 minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album). Casablanca became one of the first record labels to popularize the 12" single format. By early 1976, "Love To Love You Baby" had reached #2 on the US
 <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">

 </a>
 , while the
 <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Love_to_Love_You_Baby" title="Love to Love You Baby">

 sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer's moans and groans and some American radio stations, like several in Europe, refused to play it.

 In the mid 1980s, Summer was embroiled in a controversy. She had allegedly made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">
  AIDS
 </a>
 , which as a result had a significantly negative impact on her career and saw thousands of her records being returned to her record company by angered fans. Summer, by this time a
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Born-again_Christian" title="Born-again Christian">
  born-again Christian
 </a>
 , was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals.
 However, she denied that she had ever made any such comment and, in a letter to the AIDS campaign group
 <a href="/wiki/ACT_UP" title="ACT UP">
  ACT UP
 </a>
 in 1989, she said that it was
 <i>
  <b>
   "a terrible misunderstanding. I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters....If I have caused you pain, forgive me."
  </b>
 </i>
 She went on to apologize for the delay in refuting the rumours and closed her letter with quotes from Chapter 13 of
 <a href="/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">
  1 Corinthians
 </a>

</p>
<p>
 Also in 1989, Summer told

 magazine that
 <i>
  <b>
   "A couple of the people I write with are gay, and they have been ever since I met them. What people want to do with their bodies is their personal preference."
  </b>
 </i>
 .
 A couple of years later she filed a lawsuit against

While commenting on the album, Summer said “I wanted this album to have a lot of different directions on it. I did not want it to be any one baby. I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world. There’s a touch of this, a little smidgeon of that, a dash of something else…like when you’re cooking.” On the song “The Queen Is Back”, Summer reveals her wry and witty self-awareness of her musical legacy and her public persona. “I’m making fun of myself,” she admits. “There’s irony, it’s poking fun at the idea of being called a queen. That’s a title that has followed me, followed me, and followed me. We were sitting and writing and that title kept popping up in my mind and I’m thinking, ‘Am I supposed to write this? Is this too arrogant to write?’ But people call me ‘the queen,’ so I guess it's ok to refer to myself as what everybody else refers to me as. We started writing the song and thought it was kind of cute and funny.” Summer wrote “The Queen Is Back” and “Mr. Music” with

 </a>
 . After she had divorced from Helmuth, she moved into her Los Angeles house with lover Peter Mühldorfer, who was a respected surrealist painter. As her star continued to rise, Mühldorfer resented all the press and public attention and it drove a huge wedge between them. She has stated that he became violent and he was eventually (with the help of Casablanca Records mogul Neil Bogart) shipped back to Germany after having his visa revoked.

 . Within a few months, Summer and Sudano became an item. The couple married on July 16, 1980. A year later, Summer gave birth to another daughter (her first child with Sudano), Brooklyn (named after Sudano's group). A year after that, Summer and Sudano had their second child, Amanda.

 Summer has often talked about her early successful years as a period of confusion and anxiety. By mid-1977, struggling with the media's titles of her as
 <i>
  the first lady of love
 </i>
 , she began suffering from depression and started having

 . Summer has written in her memoirs that she had attempted

 </a>
 a few times. Her rapid rise to success, combined with some serious regrets about mistakes in her personal life, began to take its toll. During this time, she self-medicated on

 resulting in an addiction. Following a nervous breakdown at her home in 1979, Summer went to a local church attended with her sister Dara and declared herself a

 . Summer then decided that from then on, the song that had won her international fame and recognition, "
 <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Love_to_Love_You_Baby" title="Love to Love You Baby">

 </a>
 ", would no longer be performed. A quarter of a century later, however, she began performing the song again live. As recently as 2011, she even rerecorded the track, complete with racy sighs and moans, for the 'Loverdose' fragrance advertisement by Diesel.
