 in the mid 1950's and played lead guitar in the band, then called the Quarry Men, that eventually became the Beatles. During the height of the Beatles' popularity, he was often characterized as the "quiet Beatle", noted for his introspective manner and his growing interest in Indian mysticism. He acquired interest in playing the

 , which influenced the sound of the Beatles music in such songs as
 <i>
  Norwegian Wood
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Love You To
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  Within You Without You
 </i>
 . While not the primary composer in the group (Lennon and McCartney wrote most of the Beatles' material), as time went on his songs improved greatly and his material earned respect both from his fellow Beatles and the music-buying public. Notable examples include
 <i>
  Taxman
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  While My Guitar Gently Weeps
 </i>
 (which featured a guitar solo by

 After the Beatles split in

 , Harrison released a number of albums which were critically and commercially successful, both as solo projects and as the member of other groups. After many years of having been limited in his contributions to the Beatles' catalog, he unleashed a torrent of material in first major solo work released after the breakup, the triple album
 <i>
  All Things Must Pass
 </i>
 . The album included the number one hit single,
 <i>
  My Sweet Lord
 </i>
 . Harrison was later sued for copyright infringement over similarities between
 <i>
  My Sweet Lord
 </i>
 and the 1963 Chiffon's single
 <i>
  He's So Fine
 </i>
 . Harrison denied deliberately stealing the song, but he did lose the case in 1976; in the ruling, the court granted the possibility that Harrison had unconsciously taken the
 <i>
  Chiffons
 </i>
 song as the basis for his own song.
