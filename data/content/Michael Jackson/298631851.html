 Joseph Jackson was a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&amp;B band called The Falcons with his brother Luther.
 Jackson was raised as one of
 <a href="/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">
  Jehovah's Witnesses
 </a>
 by his devout mother.
</p>
<p>
 From a young age Jackson was physically and mentally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling. Jackson's abuse as a child affected him throughout his grown life.
 In one altercation—later recalled by Marlon Jackson—Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and "pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks".
 Joseph would often trip up, or push the male children into walls.
 One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.
</p>
<p>
 Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with
 <a href="/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey" title="Oprah Winfrey">
  Oprah Winfrey
 </a>
 . He said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness and would sometimes get sick or start to
 <a class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Regurgitate" title="Regurgitate">

 </a>
 upon seeing his father.
 In Jackson's other high profile interview,
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Living_with_Michael_Jackson" title="Living with Michael Jackson">
   Living with Michael Jackson
  </a>
 </i>
 (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.
 Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed and that "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you."
</p>
<p>
 Jackson showed musical talent early in his life, performing in front of classmates and others during a Christmas recital at the age of five.
 In 1964, Jackson and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congas" title="Congas">

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Tambourine" title="Tambourine">

 <a href="/wiki/The_Jackson_5" title="The Jackson 5">

 </a>
 .
 The band toured

 Though Michael sang with a "child's piping voice, he danced like a grown-up hoofer and sang with the R&amp;B/gospel inflections of

 .
 During The Jackson 5's early years, Motown's public relations team claimed that Jackson was nine years old—two years younger than he actually was—to make him appear cuter and more accessible to the mainstream audience.
 Starting in 1972, Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them
 <i>

The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade.

 said, "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing".

 Jackson suffered a setback on January 27, 1984. While filming a
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pepsi_Cola" title="Pepsi Cola">

 </a>
 commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. Happening in front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, the incident was the subject of heavy media scrutiny and elicited an outpouring of sympathy.
 PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the "Michael Jackson Burn Center" which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns.
 Jackson had his third rhinoplasty shortly afterward and grew self conscious about his appearance.
</p>
<p>
 On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the
 <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">

 </a>
 to receive an award presented by American President
 <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">
  Ronald Reagan
 </a>
 . The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.
 Jackson won eight awards during the 1984 Grammys. Unlike later albums,
 <i>

 </i>
 did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984
 <a class="mw-disambig" href="/wiki/Victory_Tour" title="Victory Tour">
  Victory Tour
 </a>
 , headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans.
 He donated his $5 million share from the Victory Tour to charity.
</p>
<p>
 Jackson co-wrote the charity single "
 <a href="/wiki/We_Are_the_World" title="We Are the World">
  We Are the World
 </a>
 " with
 <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Richie" title="Lionel Richie">

 </a>
 , which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. He was one of 39 music celebrities who performed on the record. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to

 While working with Paul McCartney on the two hit singles "

  The Girl Is Mine
 </a>
 " and "
 <a href="/wiki/Say_Say_Say" title="Say Say Say">
  Say Say Say
 </a>
 ", the pair became friendly, occasionally visiting one another. In one discussion, McCartney told Jackson about the millions of dollars he had made from music catalogs; he was earning approximately $40 million a year from other people's songs. Jackson then began a business career buying, selling and distributing publishing rights to music from numerous artists. Shortly afterward,
 <a href="/wiki/Northern_Songs" title="Northern Songs">
  Northern Songs
 </a>
 —a music catalog holding thousands of songs, including The Beatles' back catalog—was put up for sale.
</p>
<p>
 Jackson took immediate interest in the catalog but was warned that he would face strong competition. Excited, he skipped around saying, "I don't care. I want those songs. Get me those songs Branca [his attorney]". Branca then contacted the attorney of McCartney, who clarified that his client was not interested in bidding; "It's too pricey". After Jackson had started negotiations, McCartney changed his mind and tried to persuade Yoko Ono to join him in a joint bid, she declined, so he pulled out. Jackson eventually beat the rest of the competition in negotiations that lasted 10 months, purchasing the catalog for $47.5 million. When McCartney found out he said, "I think it's dodgy to do things like that. To be someone's friend and then buy the rug they're standing on". Reacting to that statement, biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli observed that McCartney made millions of dollars from the music of other people. He had more money than Jackson at that point so could have made a substantial bid for his own music and would not have suffered financial difficulties from Jackson owning the catalog.

 Jackson bought and befriended a pet chimpanzee called
 <a href="/wiki/Bubbles_(chimpanzee)" title="Bubbles (chimpanzee)">
  Bubbles
 </a>
 , an act which extended his eccentric persona. In 2003 the singer claimed that Bubbles shared his toilet, and cleaned his bedroom.
 Later it was reported that Jackson bought the bones of
 <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Merrick" title="Joseph Merrick">
  The Elephant Man
 </a>
 . Although untrue, it was a story that Jackson again disseminated to the tabloid press.
 These stories inspired the pejorative nickname "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year. He would eventually come to despise the nickname. Realizing his mistake, he stopped leaking untruths to the press. However due to the profit being made, the media began making up their own stories.
</p>
<p>
 Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the early 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler. This change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that Jackson was bleaching his skin.
 In the mid-1980s, Jackson was diagnosed with
 <a href="/wiki/Vitiligo" title="Vitiligo">
  vitiligo
 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus" title="Systemic lupus erythematosus">

 ; the latter is in
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Remission_(medicine)" title="Remission (medicine)">
  remission
 </a>
 in Jackson's case, and both illnesses make him sensitive to sunlight. The treatments he uses for his condition further lighten his skin tone, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he can appear very pale.
 The structure of his face has changed as well; several surgeons have speculated that Jackson had undergone multiple nasal surgeries, a forehead lift, thinned lips and a cheekbone surgery.
 Changes to his face were, in part, due to periods of significant weight loss.
 Jackson lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a dancer's body".
 Witnesses reported that Jackson was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from
 <a href="/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa" title="Anorexia nervosa">
  anorexia nervosa
 </a>
 ; periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem for the singer later in life.
 Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that the singer has

 , a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how they are perceived by others.

 In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million; a record breaking deal at the time.
 Jackson released his eighth album

 In a high-profile visit to Africa, Jackson visited several countries, among them Gabon and Egypt.
 His first stop to Gabon was greeted with a sizable reception of more than 100,000 people in "spiritual bedlam", some of them carrying signs that read, "Welcome Home Michael".
 In his trip to the Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief.
 He then thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed official documents formalizing his kingship and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.

<p>
 One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at

As he landed on the canvass, he maintained a motionless "clenched fist, standing statue stance", dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for several minutes while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and began to sing and dance. His routine included four songs: "

 by a 13-year-old child named Jordan Chandler and his father Evan Chandler.
 The friendship between Jackson and Evan Chandler broke down. Sometime afterward, Evan Chandler was tape-recorded saying amongst other things, "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever...Michael's career will be over".
 A year after they had met, under the influence of a controversial

 Evan Chandler and Jackson, represented by their legal teams, then engaged in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue in a financial settlement; the negotiations were initiated by Chandler but Jackson did make several counter offers. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing,

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Oral_sex" title="Oral sex">

 </a>
 , as well as giving a detailed description of what he alleged were the singer's genitals.
</p>
<p>
 An official investigation began, with Jordan Chandler's mother adamant that there was no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Neverland Ranch was searched; multiple children and family members denied that he was a
 <a href="/wiki/Pedophilia" title="Pedophilia">

 </a>

 Jackson's image took a further turn for the worse when his older sister
 <a href="/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson" title="La Toya Jackson">

 accused him of being a pedophile, a statement she later retracted.
 Jackson agreed to a 25-minute
 <a href="/wiki/Strip_search" title="Strip search">

 </a>
 , conducted at his ranch. The search was required to see if a description provided by Jordan Chandler was accurate. Doctors concluded that there were some strong similarities, but it was not a definitive match.
 Jackson made an emotional public statement on the events; he proclaimed his innocence, criticized what he perceived as biased media coverage and told of his strip search.

<p>
 Jackson began taking

 <a href="/wiki/Diazepam" title="Diazepam">

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Lorazepam" title="Lorazepam">
  Ativan
 </a>
 to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him. By the fall of 1993, Jackson was addicted to the drugs.
 His health deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour and went into drug rehabilitation for a few months.
 The stress of the allegations also caused Jackson to stop eating, losing a significant amount of weight.
 With his health in decline, Jackson's friends and legal advisers took over his defense and finances; they called on him to settle the allegations out of court, believing that he could not endure a lengthy trial.
</p>
<p>
 Tabloid reaction to the allegations put Jackson in an unfavorable light.
 Complaints about the coverage and media included everything from bias against Jackson, accepting stories of alleged criminal activity for money to accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid.
 On January 1, 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandler family and their legal team out of court, in a civil lawsuit for $22 million. After the settlement Jordan Chandler refused to continue with Police criminal proceedings. Jackson was never charged, and the state closed its criminal investigation, citing lack of evidence.

<p>
 Later that year, Jackson married singer-songwriter
 <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Presley" title="Lisa Marie Presley">
  Lisa Marie Presley
 </a>
 , the daughter of
 <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">

 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MGM_Grand_Hotel_and_Casino" title="MGM Grand Hotel and Casino">
  MGM Grand
 </a>
 , and were reconnected through a mutual friend in early 1993.
 They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Lisa Marie for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs.
 Lisa Marie explained, "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it."
 In a phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.
 Shortly afterward, she tried to persuade Jackson to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover—he subsequently did both.
 Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie over the telephone towards the fall of 1993, saying, "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?".
 Presley and Jackson married in the
 <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">
  Dominican Republic
 </a>
 in secrecy; the parties denied they had been married for nearly two months.
 The marriage was, in her words, "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active".
 At the time, the tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image in light of prior sexual abuse allegations.
 Jackson and Presley divorced less than two years later, remaining friendly.

 During the Australian leg of the HIStory World Tour, Jackson married

 <a href="/wiki/Vitiligo" title="Vitiligo">

 . She spent many years treating his illness as well as providing emotional support. They built a strong friendship, then became romantically involved.
 Originally there were no plans to marry, but following Rowe's first pregnancy, Jackson's mother intervened and persuaded them to.
 The couple divorced in 1999, with Rowe giving full custody rights of the children to Jackson; they still remain friends.

<p>
 In 2000, Jackson was listed in the book of
 <i>
  Guinness World Records
 </i>
 for his support of 39 charities, more than any other entertainer or personality.
 At the time, Jackson was waiting for the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert back to him; this allowed him to promote his old material how he liked and prevented Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, this revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a
 <a href="/wiki/Conflict_of_interest" title="Conflict of interest">
  conflict of interest
 </a>
 .
 Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been pushing to buy all of Jackson's share in their music catalog venture. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, he would have to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.
 Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.
 Just before the release of
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Invincible_(Michael_Jackson_album)" title="Invincible (Michael Jackson album)">
   Invincible
  </a>
 </i>
 , Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment,
 <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Mottola" title="Tommy Mottola">
  Tommy Mottola
 </a>
 , that he was leaving Sony.
 As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the
 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 album were canceled. Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a "devil" and a "racist" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.
 He charged that Mottola had called his colleague
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Irving_Lorenzo" title="Irving Lorenzo">
  Irv Gotti
 </a>
 a "fat
 <a href="/wiki/Nigger" title="Nigger">

 </a>
 ".
 Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote
 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the US.
</p>
<p>
 Six years after his last studio album and after spending much of the late 1990s to early millennium out of the public eye, Jackson released
 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 in October 2001 to much anticipation. To help promote the album, a special
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Michael_Jackson:_30th_Anniversary_Special" title="Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special">
  30th Anniversary celebration
 </a>
 at Madison Square Garden occurred in September 2001 to mark the singer's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984.
 The show also featured performances by

 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 was a commercial success, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 10 million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the US.
 However, the sales for
 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 were notably low compared to his previous releases, due in part to a diminishing pop music industry, the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.
 The album spawned three singles, "

 Jackson's third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (also known as Blanket) was born in 2002.

Holding him in his right arm, with a cloth loosely draped over the baby's face, Jackson briefly extended the baby over the railing of the balcony, four stories above ground level, causing widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".

 <i>

 , saying that she had been there when they "were in the bed, watching television. There was nothing abnormal about it. There was no touchy-feely going on. We laughed like children and we watched a lot of Walt Disney. There was nothing odd about it."
 During the investigation, Jackson's profile was examined by a mental health professional called Dr. Stan Katz; the doctor spent several hours with the accuser too. The assessment made by Katz, was that Jackson had become a regressed 10-year-old and did not fit the profile of a pedophile.

 Reports of financial problems for Jackson became frequent in 2006 after the closure of the main house on the Neverland Ranch as a cost-cutting measure.
 One prominent financial issue for him concerned a $270 million loan secured against his music publishing holdings. After delayed repayments on the loan, a refinancing package shifted the loans from
 <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_America" title="Bank of America">
  Bank of America
 </a>
 to debt specialists
 <a href="/wiki/Fortress_Investment_Group" title="Fortress Investment Group">
  Fortress Investments
 </a>
 . A new package proposed by Sony would have had Jackson borrow an additional $300 million and reduce the interest rate payable on the loan, while giving Sony the future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly owned publishing company (leaving Jackson with a 25% stake).
 Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal, although details were not made public.
 Despite these loans, according to Forbes, Jackson was still making as much as $75 million a year from his publishing partnership with Sony alone.
</p>
<p>
 One of Jackson's first documented public appearances since his trial was in November 2006, when he visited the London office of the
 <i>
  Guinness World Records
 </i>
 . He received eight records, among them "First Entertainer to Earn More Than 100 Million Dollars in a Year" and "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time".
 Jackson was awarded the

 Steve Huey of
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Allmusic" title="Allmusic">
  Allmusic
 </a>
 asserts that throughout his solo career, Jackson's versatility has allowed him to experiment with various themes and genres.
 As a musician, he has ranged from
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motown_Records" title="Motown Records">

 </a>
 dance fare and ballads to

 Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper. Instead he would dictate into a sound recorder; when recording he would sing from memory.
 Several critics observed

 ,

 Prominent examples include the ballad "

 </a>
 ", and the two disco tunes "Workin' Day and Night" and "Get on the Floor".
</p>
<p>
 According to Huey,
 <i>
  Thriller
 </i>
 refined the strengths of
 <i>
  Off the Wall
 </i>
 ; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.
 Notable tracks included the ballads "The Lady in My Life", "Human Nature" and "
 <a href="/wiki/The_Girl_Is_Mine" title="The Girl Is Mine">
  The Girl Is Mine

 "; the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "

 With
 <i>
  Thriller
 </i>
 , Christoper Connelly of
 <i>
  Rolling Stone
 </i>
 commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of
 <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">
  paranoia
 </a>
 and darker imagery.
 Allmusic's
 <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine" title="Stephen Thomas Erlewine">
  Stephen Thomas Erlewine
 </a>
 noted this is evident on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".
 In "Billie Jean", Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers.
 In "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media.
 The anti-gang violence rock song "Beat It" became a homage to
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/West_Side_Story" title="West Side Story">
   West Side Story
  </a>
 </i>
 , and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.
 He also observed that the title track "
 <a href="/wiki/Thriller_(song)" title="Thriller (song)">
  Thriller
 </a>
 " began Jackson's interest with the theme of the
 <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" title="Supernatural">
  supernatural

 , a topic he revisited in subsequent years.
 In 1985, Jackson wrote the charity anthem "
 <a href="/wiki/We_Are_the_World" title="We Are the World">

 </a>
 "; humanitarian themes later became a central component of his life and music.

<h3>
 <span class="mw-headline" id="Vocal_style">
  Vocal style
 </span>
</h3>
<p>
 Jackson has been singing since a child, and over time his voice and vocal style have notably changed, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chooses to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice "descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor".
 In the mid-1970s, the singer adopted a "vocal hiccup" as seen in "
 <a href="/wiki/Shake_Your_Body_(Down_to_the_Ground)" title="Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)">
  Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)
 </a>
 ". The purpose of the hiccup—somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping—is to help promote a certain emotion, be it excitement, sadness or fear.
 With the arrival of
 <i>
  Off the Wall
 </i>
 in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Allmusic described him as a "blindingly gifted vocalist".
 At the time,
 <i>
  Rolling Stone
 </i>
 compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of
 <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Wonder" title="Stevie Wonder">
  Stevie Wonder
 </a>
 . Their analysis was also that "Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling
 <a href="/wiki/Falsetto" title="Falsetto">
  falsetto
 </a>
 that's used very daringly".
 1982 saw the release of
 <i>
  Thriller
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  Rolling Stone
 </i>
 were of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".

 The release of "Bad" in 1987 displayed gritty lead vocals on the verse and lighter tones employed on the chorus.
 A distinctive deliberate mispronunciation used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelt "cha'mone" or "shamone", is also a staple in impressions and caricatures of him.
 The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the paradoxical, introspective album
 <i>
  Dangerous
 </i>
 , here Jackson used his vocals to intensify the split themes and genres described earlier.
 <i>
  The New York Times
 </i>
 noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone".
 When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.
 "In the Closet" contained heavy breathing and a loop of five scat-sung syllables, whereas in the album's title track, Jackson performs a spoken rap.
 When commenting on
 <i>
  Invincible
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Rolling Stone
 </i>
 were of the opinion that—at the age of 43—Jackson still performed, "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".
 Nelson George summed by Jackson's vocals as, "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist".

 Steve Huey of Allmusic observed how Jackson transformed the
 <a href="/wiki/Music_video" title="Music video">
  music video
 </a>
 into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances; simultaneously breaking down racial barriers.
 According to director
 <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Paterson" title="Vincent Paterson">
  Vincent Paterson
 </a>
 , who collaborated with the singer on several music videos, Jackson conceptualized many of the darker, bleak themes in his filmography.
</p>
<p>
 Before
 <i>
  Thriller
 </i>
 , Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV because he was African American.
 Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", leading to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, also helping other black music artists gain recognition.
 The popularity of his videos on
 <a href="/wiki/MTV" title="MTV">
  MTV
 </a>
 helped to put the relatively young channel "on the map"; MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R&amp;B.
 Short films like
 <i>
  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thriller_(music_video)" title="Thriller (music video)">
   Thriller
  </a>
 </i>
 largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in "Beat It" has frequently been imitated.
 The choreography in
 <i>

 has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from

 —Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not previously seen in his work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. While he has described this as "choreography," it garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics;
 <i>

 magazine described it as "infamous". The video also featured

 It featured scenes construed as having a sexual nature as well as depictions of violence. The offending scenes in the final half of the 14-minute version were edited out to prevent the video from being banned, and Jackson apologized.
