 . Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, "challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day" and "created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture."
 The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved to be one facet of a career marked by reinvention, musical innovation and visual presentation.

 David Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947, in
 <a href="/wiki/Brixton" title="Brixton">
  Brixton
 </a>
 , London. His mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns), from Kent,
 worked as a waitress,
 while his father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones, from Yorkshire,
 was a promotions officer for
 <a href="/wiki/Barnardo%27s" title="Barnardo's">

 . The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, located near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and
 <a href="/wiki/Stockwell" title="Stockwell">

 </a>
 . Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.
</p>
<p>
 In 1953 the family moved to the suburb of
 <a href="/wiki/Bromley" title="Bromley">
  Bromley
 </a>
 , where, two years later, Bowie progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and his

 playing judged to demonstrate above-average musical ability.
 At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced

 classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child.
 The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American

 Upon listening to "

 </a>
 ' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that."

 at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie joined

  Bromley Technical High School
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford writes:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
 <p>
  Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English]

  <a href="/wiki/William_Wilberforce" title="William Wilberforce">

  </a>
  . There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son,
  <a href="/wiki/Peter_Frampton" title="Peter Frampton">
   Peter
  </a>
  , to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.
 </p>

<p>
 Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, introduced him to modern

 Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend

 punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. Doctors feared he would become blind in that eye. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation,
 his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty

 Graduating from his plastic saxophone to a real instrument in 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based
 <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">

 </a>
 at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.
 When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his band-mates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur
 <a href="/wiki/John_Bloom_(businessman)" title="John Bloom (businessman)">

<p>
 Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, "

 "He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."

 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale;
 the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and bassist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk,
 <a href="/wiki/Beat_music" title="Beat music">

 Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film,

 <a href="/wiki/Kit_Kat" title="Kit Kat">

 On 11 July 1969, "Space Oddity" was released five days ahead of the
 <a href="/wiki/Apollo_11" title="Apollo 11">
  Apollo 11
 </a>
 launch, to become a UK top five hit.
 Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in
 <a href="/wiki/Beckenham" title="Beckenham">

 Influenced by the
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arts_Lab_Movement" title="Arts Lab Movement">

 <a href="/wiki/Memory_of_a_Free_Festival" title="Memory of a Free Festival">

 Bowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie_(1969_album)" title="David Bowie (1969 album)">

  </a>
 </i>
 , it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled
 <i>
  Man of Words/Man of Music
 </i>
 ; it was re-released internationally in 1972 by RCA as
 <i>
  Space Oddity
 </i>
 . Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.
</p>
<p>
 Bowie met
 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angela_Bowie" title="Angela Bowie">
  Angela Barnett
 </a>
 in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating.
 Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for gigs and recording—people he could relate to personally".
 The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with
 <a href="/wiki/Marc_Bolan" title="Marc Bolan">
  Marc Bolan
 </a>
 , who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.
 A band was duly assembled. John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, was joined by

 Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new

 During the tour Bowie's observation of two seminal American

 The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the course of the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."

 Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."
 His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both
 <i>
  Ziggy Stardust
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Aladdin Sane
 </i>
 , were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a

 was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US.
 Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "for all his record sales (over a million copies of
 <i>
  Ziggy Stardust
 </i>
 alone), existed essentially on loose change."
 In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."
 Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.

 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Franco" title="General Franco">

 </a>
 was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing conversation with Harty, as described by biographer David Buckley, "the singer made hardly any sense at all throughout what was quite an extensive interview. ... Bowie looked completely disconnected and was hardly able to utter a coherent sentence."
 His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.

 . Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave.
 He later blamed his pro-Fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke.
 "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur".
 According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in
 <i>
  The Times
 </i>
 , "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs."

 Bowie moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of
 <a href="/wiki/Lake_Geneva" title="Lake Geneva">

 </a>
 . In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career. He devoted more time to his painting, and produced a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in
 <a href="/wiki/Geneva" title="Geneva">

 and the
 <a href="/wiki/Br%C3%BCcke_Museum" title="Brücke Museum">

 in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. […] Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography."

 Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to
 <a href="/wiki/West_Berlin" title="West Berlin">
  West Berlin
 </a>
 to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in
 <a href="/wiki/Sch%C3%B6neberg" title="Schöneberg">

 and
 <a href="/wiki/Hansa_Tonstudio" title="Hansa Tonstudio">

 </a>
 .
 While working with
 <a href="/wiki/Brian_Eno" title="Brian Eno">

 </a>
 and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with
 <a href="/wiki/Tony_Visconti" title="Tony Visconti">
  Tony Visconti
 </a>
 , that became known as his Berlin Trilogy.
 During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut
 <i>

<p>
 The album

 (1977), partly influenced by the

 <a href="/wiki/Kraftwerk" title="Kraftwerk">

 , evidenced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it.
 It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings,
 <i>
  Low
 </i>
 yielded the UK number three single "
 <a href="/wiki/Sound_and_Vision" title="Sound and Vision">
  Sound and Vision
 </a>
 ", and its own performance surpassed that of
 <i>
  Station to Station
 </i>
 in the UK chart, where it reached number two. Leading contemporary composer
 <a href="/wiki/Philip_Glass" title="Philip Glass">
  Philip Glass
 </a>
 described
 <i>
  Low
 </i>
 as "a work of genius" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._1_(Glass)" title="Symphony No. 1 (Glass)">
   Symphony No. 1 "Low"
  </a>
 </i>
 ; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._4_(Glass)" title="Symphony No. 4 (Glass)">
   Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"
  </a>
 </i>
 .
 Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces".

<p>
 After completing
 <i>
  Low
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  "Heroes"
 </i>
 , Bowie spent much of 1978 on the
 <a href="/wiki/Isolar_II_%E2%80%93_The_1978_World_Tour" title="Isolar II – The 1978 World Tour">
  Isolar II world tour
 </a>
 , bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."
 Recordings from the tour made up the live album

 cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.
 The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's
 <i>
  Sergeant Pepper
 </i>
 ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno."
 <i>
  Lodger

 Though he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.
 The band's album debut,
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Tin_Machine_(album)" title="Tin Machine (album)">
   Tin Machine
  </a>
 </i>
 (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of neo-Nazis"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."
 EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production".
 The album nevertheless reached number three in the UK.
 Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member.
 A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label.
 Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band.
 Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month
 <a href="/wiki/Sound%2BVision_Tour" title="Sound+Vision Tour">
  Sound+Vision Tour

 , he found commercial success and acclaim once again.

 In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angela, Bowie and

  Iman
 </a>
 were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate." They married in 1992.
 Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second.

 <a href="/wiki/Kouros" title="Kouros">

 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Tin_Machine_Live:_Oy_Vey,_Baby" title="Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby">

 The show's director, Johan Renck, said of Bowie, "His first response was precise, engaged and curious. The piece of music he laid before us embodied every aspect of our characters and the series itself - dark, brooding, beautiful and sentimental (in the best possible incarnation of this word). All along, the man inspired and intrigued me and as the process passed, I was overwhelmed with his generosity. I still can't fathom what actually happened." The theme that will be used for

 Biographer David Buckley writes, "The essence of Bowie's contribution to popular music can be found in his outstanding ability to analyse and select ideas from outside the mainstream—from art, literature, theatre and film—and to bring them inside, so that the currency of pop is constantly being changed."
 Buckley says, "Just one person took glam rock to new rarefied heights and invented character-playing in pop, marrying theatre and popular music in one seamless, powerful whole."
 Bowie's career has also been punctuated by various roles in film and theatre productions, earning him some acclaim as an actor in his own right.

 From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie has employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by not only rock and rollers like

 </a>
 and
 <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">

 </a>

 (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher).

 ", and later in the song "

 Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as "particularly deliberate and distinctive".
 Schinder and Schwartz call him "a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect."
 Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's chamaeleon-like nature is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics "arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."
 In a 2014 analysis of 77 "top" artists' vocal ranges, Bowie was 8th, just behind

 Bowie's innovative songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. A pioneer of glam rock, Bowie, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, has joint responsibility with Marc Bolan for creating the genre.
 At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement—historian Michael Campbell calls him "one of punk's seminal influences". While punk musicians trashed the conventions of pop stardom, Bowie moved on again—into a more abstract style of music making that in turn became a transforming influence. Biographer David Buckley writes, "At a time when punk rock was noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance, Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation."
 Bowie's record company sought to convey his unique status in popular music with the slogan, "There is old wave, there is new wave, and there is Bowie ..."
 Musicologist James Perone credits him with having "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledge the intellectual depth of his work and influence.
</p>
<p>
 Buckley writes that, in an early 1970s pop world that was "Bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied, ... Bowie challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day." As described by
 <a href="/wiki/John_Peel" title="John Peel">
  John Peel
 </a>
 , "The one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change." Buckley says that Bowie "subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star", with the result that "After Bowie there has been no other pop icon of his stature, because the pop world that produces these rock gods doesn't exist any more. ... The fierce partisanship of the cult of Bowie was also unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom." Buckley concludes that "Bowie is both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."
</p>
<p>
 Bowie was inducted into the
 <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">
  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
 </a>
 in 1996.
 Through perpetual reinvention, he has seen his influence continue to broaden and extend: music reviewer Brad Filicky writes that over the decades, "Bowie has become known as a musical chameleon, changing and dictating trends as much as he has altered his style to fit, influencing fashion and pop culture."
 Biographer Thomas Forget adds, "Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie."

 Bowie married Mary Angela Barnett (also known as

 , London. They had a son together, Zowie Bowie (now known as
 <a href="/wiki/Duncan_Jones" title="Duncan Jones">

 </a>
 , film director), and divorced on 8 February 1980 in Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
 Buckley writes, "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality."
 Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts in 22 January 1972 issue of
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker" title="Melody Maker">
   Melody Maker
  </a>
 </i>
 ,
 a move which coincided with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust.
 In a September 1976 interview with
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">
   Playboy
  </a>
 </i>
 , Bowie said: "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."
 According to his first wife Angie, Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.
</p>
<p>
 In a 1983 interview with
 <i>
  Rolling Stone
 </i>
 , Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake I ever made" and "I was always a closet heterosexual."
 On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings; as described by Buckley, he said he had been driven more by "a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being."

<p>
 Asked in 2002 by
 <i>
  <a href="/wiki/Blender_(magazine)" title="Blender (magazine)">
   Blender
  </a>
 </i>
 whether he still believed his public declaration was the biggest mistake he ever made, he replied:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
 <p>
  Interesting. [Long pause] I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer, and I felt that bisexuality became my headline over here for so long. America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Buckley's view of the period is that Bowie, "a taboo-breaker and a dabbler ... mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock",
 and that "it is probably true that Bowie was never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual ... he did, from time to time, experiment, even if only out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional.' "
 Biographer Christopher Sandford says that according to Mary Finnigan, with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969, the singer and his first wife Angie "lived in a fantasy world ... and they created their bisexual fantasy."
 Sandford tells how, during the marriage, Bowie "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women."

 Regarding his religion, in 2005 he said, "Questioning my spiritual life has always been germane to what I was writing. Always." He added that he is bothered by being "not quite an atheist".
 In the

 interview "What I've Learned", he stated, "I'm in awe of the universe, but I don't necessarily believe there's an intelligence or agent behind it. I do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals, though, even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance. The incense is powerful and provocative, whether Buddhist or Catholic."

 and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." He was also quoted as saying: "Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars" and "You've got to have an
